# WinUI3Preview4_Problems_FileOpenPicker

This repository contains two solutions with sample code demonstrating the FileOpenPicker in both UWP and WinUI3 Preview4.

In the UWP sample solution, the FileOpenPicker works as expected for both single file selection (PickSingleFileAsync) and the multiple files selection (PickMultipleFilesAsync).

However, the WinUI3 Preview 4 Desktop sample solution breaks on the multiple files selection and open (PickMultipleFilesAsync).

This issue has persisted from Preview 2 and 3.
